# Computational-Fluid-Dynamics-MAE-561
This study is about fluid flow and mixing dynamics in a two-dimensional rectangular mixing cham
ber using computational modeling. It investigates the behavior of two chemical species absorbed by
 rotating disks, employing advanced numerical methods. The Immersed Boundary method, along with
 fractional step schemes like Adams-Bashforth/Crank Nicolson for momentum equations and WENO5
TVD-RK-3/Crank Nicolson for mass fraction equations, is utilized. Performance metrics such as average
 kinetic energy and mixing parameters are rigorously assessed. Findings provide detailed insights into
 flow patterns, species distribution, and mixing efficiency, fostering insightful discussions.
